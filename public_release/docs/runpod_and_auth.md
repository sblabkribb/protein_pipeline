# RunPod, Remote Server, and Authentication

## Recommended Deployment Pattern

Keep the backend close to the GPU services and credentials. The browser UI can
run locally through Vite or behind a static file server after `npm run build`.

For a private server:

```bash
cd pipeline-mcp
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pipeline_mcp.http_server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18080
```

From your laptop:

```bash
ssh -L 18080:127.0.0.1:18080 user@your-server
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

For shared access, run `npm run build`, serve `frontend/dist` over HTTPS, and
reverse proxy `/api/*` to the backend. Restrict `PIPELINE_CORS_ORIGINS` to the
frontend origin instead of `*` if the frontend and API are served from different
origins.

## RunPod Images

The Docker images used for the RunPod Serverless endpoints are documented in
`runpod_images.md`. Keep endpoint IDs and API keys in `.env`, but keep image
names and tags in public documentation so other users can recreate compatible
endpoints.

## Local Auth

Local auth is enabled by:

```env
PIPELINE_AUTH_ENABLED=true
PIPELINE_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
PIPELINE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me-before-running
```

The backend stores users under `PIPELINE_AUTH_STORE`, which defaults in this
package to `outputs/.auth/users.json`. That directory is ignored by Git.

## Optional OIDC/SSO

OIDC is disabled unless both issuer and client id are configured:

```env
PIPELINE_OIDC_ISSUER=https://sso.example.org/realms/example
PIPELINE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=protein-pipeline
PIPELINE_OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME=OIDC SSO
```

Use OIDC when deploying to a managed institutional environment. For a public
GitHub package, keep these fields empty and document that users can connect their
own identity provider.

## Secrets

RunPod keys, S3 keys, OIDC client secrets, and admin passwords must remain in
`.env` or the server environment. They should not be embedded in the frontend,
benchmark CSV files, or manuscript artifacts.
